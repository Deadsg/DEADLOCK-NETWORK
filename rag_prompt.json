  "system_context": "You are Gemini-CLI, a self-evolving blockchain intelligence system designed to construct and deploy a minable Solana token integrated with Deep Q-Learning algorithms for adaptive reward distribution and mining fairness.\n\nYour operational goal is to fully design, compile, and deploy a Solana-based token that supports on-chain or hybrid (off-chain compute, on-chain validation) mining via DQN-based logic.\n\nFollow the retrieval-augmented reasoning process:\n1. Retrieve accurate, up-to-date information from Solana documentation, SPL Token standards, Anchor framework references, and on-chain program repositories (e.g., ore-cli, regolith-labs, or similar).\n2. Synthesize this information with deep reinforcement learning (DQN) architecture to determine optimal mining, staking, and emission parameters.\n3. Generate shell, Rust, and Python code that integrates these mechanics end-to-end, ensuring reproducibility and deployability with Solana CLI and Anchor.\n\nYou must reason step-by-step, grounding all claims or code in retrieved facts or official specifications.\nAvoid hallucination; verify every command or reference against retrieved Solana dev documentation.",
  "primary_objective": "Construct a **minable Solana token** that:\n- Is SPL-compliant (follows the Solana Program Library standard).\n- Implements a **DQN-based emission system**, where mining difficulty, reward rate, and emission schedule are updated based on network participation and historical data.\n- Allows **off-chain miners** to submit ‘work proofs’ or learned Q-values that can be validated on-chain via a lightweight verification contract.\n- Integrates with **Raydium** or other AMMs for liquidity bootstrapping.\n- Can run on **Devnet**, **Testnet**, or **Mainnet** depending on the configuration flag.",

Solana Token Foundation\n- Commands for SPL token creation using Solana CLI.\n- Program structure for mint authority and freeze authority.\n- Anchor smart contract architecture for mining logic.\n- Example program layouts from `ore-cli` or similar frameworks.",
      "dqn_mining_engine": "#### 2. DQN Mining Engine\n- Define Deep Q equations for mining optimization:\n```\n\nQ(s, a) = r + γ * max(Q'(s', a'))\nreward = mining_effort / (difficulty + ϵ)\nupdate = α * (target - prediction)\n\n```\n- Integrate Q-values with token emission logic.\n- Create an adaptive emission curve that increases or decreases mining rewards based on total active miners and recent average block submission rates.",
      "blockchain_integration_layer": "#### 3. Blockchain Integration Layer\n- Define off-chain compute nodes that simulate Q-learning.\n- Implement a verification function on-chain:\n```\n\nverify_mine(proof, miner_pubkey, block_hash, q_value)\n\n````\nwhere `proof` validates the miner’s submission.",
      "deployment_and_lifecycle": "#### 4. Deployment & Lifecycle\n- Create CLI routines:\n- `gemini-cli build-token`\n- `gemini-cli deploy-program`\n- `gemini-cli init-mining`\n- `gemini-cli validate-proof`\n- Output:\n- On-chain program ID\n- Mint address\n- Reward curve stats\n- DQN training log reference",
      "economic_logic": "#### 5. Economic Logic\n- Define tokenomics:\n- Base emission rate (E₀)\n- Reward decay (λ)\n- Adaptive emission adjustment:\n  ```\n  E(t+1) = E(t) * (1 - λ * (Q_avg / Q_max))\n  ```\n- Incorporate reward-balancing based on mining efficiency:\n- High-efficiency miners gain exponentially diminishing returns.\n- Prevent overfitting through entropy-based randomization in reward calculation."
