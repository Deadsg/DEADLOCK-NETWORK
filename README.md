# DEADLOCK-NETWORK

## Project Overview

DEADLOCK-NETWORK is an ambitious project integrating blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and decentralized applications to create a unique ecosystem. At its core, it features a custom blockchain, a Solana-based token (`DEADSGOLD`), and AI-driven agents (Deep Q-Networks) that interact with the network, potentially for mining, trading, or other decentralized operations.

The project aims to explore the synergy between AI and blockchain, providing a robust framework for decentralized applications and a novel approach to network interaction and value creation.

## Key Components:

*   **Blockchain Core:** A custom blockchain implementation (`blockchain/`).
*   **DEADSGOLD Token:** A Solana-based token (`DEADSGOLD/`) with on-chain metadata, designed for the network's economy.
*   **DQN Agents:** Deep Q-Network (DQN) powered AI agents (`dqn/`, `DQNAgent/`) for intelligent interaction within the network.
*   **Miner:** A dedicated mining component (`miner/`, `solana_deadsgold_miner_program/`) for network participation and token generation.
*   **Solana Integration:** Modules for interacting with the Solana blockchain (`solana_integration/`, `solana_program/`).
*   **API & Backend:** Core backend services and APIs (`api/`, `backend/`).
*   **Frontend & GUI:** User interfaces and graphical applications (`frontend/`, `gui/`, `java/`, `node/`, `react-app/`, `my-app/`).
*   **Rust Components:** Performance-critical utilities, including a Rust hasher (`rust_hasher/`).
